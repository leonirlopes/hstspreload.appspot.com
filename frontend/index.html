      This form is used to submit domains for inclusion in Chrome's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security">HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)</a> preload list.
      This is a list of sites that are hardcoded into Chrome as being HTTPS only.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most major browsers (Chrome, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2012/11/01/preloading-hsts/">Firefox</a>, Opera, Safari, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/06/09/http-strict-transport-security-comes-to-internet-explorer-11-on-windows-8-1-and-windows-7/">IE 11 and Edge</a>) also have HSTS preload lists based on the Chrome list. (See the <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=stricttransportsecurity">HSTS compatibility matrix</a>.)
    </p>

  <section id="submission-requirements">
    <h2><a class="hash-link" href="#submission-requirements">Submission Requirements</a></h2>
    <p>If a site sends the <tt>preload</tt> directive in an HSTS header, it is considered be requesting inclusion in the preload list and may be submitted via the form on this site.</p>
    <p>In order to be accepted to the HSTS preload list through this form, your site must satisfy the following set of requirements:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Serve a valid <b>certificate</b>.</li>
      <li><b>Redirect</b> from HTTP to HTTPS on the same host.</li>
      <li>Serve all <b>subdomains</b> over HTTPS.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>In particular, you must support HTTPS for the <tt>www</tt> subdomain if a DNS record for that subdomain exists.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Serve an <b>HSTS header</b> on the base domain for HTTPS requests:
        <ul>
          <li>The <tt>max-age</tt> must be at least eighteen weeks (<tt>10886400</tt> seconds).</li>
          <li>The <tt>includeSubDomains</tt> directive must be specified.</li>
          <li>The <tt>preload</tt> directive must be specified.</li>
          <li>If you are serving an additional redirect from your HTTPS site, that redirect must still have the HSTS header (rather than the page it redirects to).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      For more details on HSTS, please see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797">RFC 6797</a>.

      Here is an example of a valid HSTS header:
    </p>
    <p class="header-example main-header-example"">
      <span><tt>Strict-Transport-Security:</tt></span> <span><tt>max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload</tt></span>
    </p>

    <p>
      You can check the status of your request by entering the domain name again in the form above, or consult the current Chrome preload list by visiting <tt>chrome://net-internals/#hsts</tt> in your browser.
      Note that new entries are hardcoded into to the Chrome source code and can take several months before they reach the stable version.

  <section id="deployment-recommendations">
    <h2><a class="hash-link" href="#deployment-recommendations">Deployment Recommendations</a></h2>

    <p>
      If your site is committed to HTTPS and you want to preload HSTS, we suggest the following steps:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Examine all subdomains (and nested subdomains) of your site and make sure that they work properly over HTTPS.</li>
      <li>Add the <tt>Strict-Transport-Security</tt> header to all HTTPS responses and ramp up the <tt>max-age</tt> in stages, using the following header values:
        <ul>
          <li>
            5 minutes:<br>
            <tt class="header-example">max-age=300; includeSubDomains</tt>
          </li>
          <li>
            1 week:<br>
            <tt class="header-example">max-age=604800; includeSubDomains</tt>
          </li>
          <li>
            1 month:<br>
            <tt class="header-example">max-age=2592000; includeSubDomains</tt>
          </li>
        </ul>
        During each stage, fix any problems that come up and then wait the full <tt>max-age</tt> of the stage before you move on (e.g. wait a month in the last stage).
      <li>Once you're confident that there will be no more issues, increase the <tt>max-age</tt> to 2 years and submit your site to the preload list:
        <ul>
          <li>
            2 years, requesting to be preloaded:<br>
            <tt class="header-example">max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload</tt>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      If you have a group of employees or users who can beta test the deployment, consider trying the first few ramp-up stages on those users. Then make sure to go through all stages for all users, starting over from the beginning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consult the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Guidelines/Web_Security">Mozilla Web Security guidelines</a> and the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/?hl=en">Google Web Fundamentals pages on security</a> for more concrete advice about HTTPS deployment.

    <h2><a class="hash-link" href="#continued-requirements">Continued Requirements</a></h2>
    <p>
      You must make sure your site continues to satisfy the submission requirements at all times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chrome has not yet removed any domains from the preload list for failing to keep up the requirements after submission, but there are plans to do so in the future. In particular, note that the <a href="#submission-requirements">requirements above</a> apply to all domains submitted through <tt>hstspreload.appspot.com</tt> on or after <b>February 29, 2016</b> (i.e. preloaded after Chrome 50).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="removal">
    <h2><a class="hash-link" href="#removal">Removal</a></h2>
    <p>
      Be aware that inclusion in the preload list cannot easily be undone.
      Domains can be removed, but it takes months for a change to reach users with a Chrome update and we cannot make guarantees about other browsers.
      Don't request inclusion unless you're sure that you can support HTTPS for <b>your entire site and all its subdomains</b> the long term.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, we will generally honor requests to be removed from Chrome's preload list if you find that you have a subdomain that you cannot serve over HTTPS for strong technical or cost reasons.
      To request removal, please:
      <ul>
        <li>Continue to serve an HSTS header over HTTPS from the domain in question, but remove the <tt>preload</tt> directive.</li>
        <li>Contact the email at the bottom of this page with the subject <tt>Removal Request: [your domain]</tt>
          <ul>
            <li>Please use <a href="mailto:hstspreload@chromium.org?Subject=Removal%20Request%3A%20%5Bdomain%5D&Body=Hello%20Lucas%2C%0A%0ACould%20you%20please%20remove%20%5Bdomain%5D%20from%20the%20HSTS%20preload%20list%3F%0AWe%20cannot%20support%20HTTPS%20on%20the%20following%20subdomains%3A%0A%0A%E2%80%A2%20%5Bsubdomain%5D%20-%20reason%0A%E2%80%A2%20%5Bsubdomain%5D%20-%20reason%0A%E2%80%A2%20...%0A%0AThanks%2C%0A%5Bname%5D">this email template</a>.</li>
            <li>Give specific reasons why you cannot stay preloaded (e.g. which subdomains cannot be moved to HTTPS and why).</li>
            <li>If you never intended to be preloaded, please let us know if you can tell why your domain was sending an HSTS header with the <tt>preload</tt> directive.
            <li>If possible, please send the request from the WHOIS contact email for the domain.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      It is up to you whether you would like remove the <tt>includeSubDomains</tt> directive or change the <tt>max-age</tt> value, as long as you remove the <tt>preload</tt> directive. In particular, you may want to set <tt>max-age=0</tt> as a <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2012/11/01/preloading-hsts/">knockout entry</a> for Firefox.
